## Example: Go Game AI with Reinforcement Learning

This module includes a practical example of reinforcement learning applied to the game of Go. The example demonstrates how to implement an AI agent that learns to play Go using deep reinforcement learning techniques.

### Components of the Example

1. **GoBoard Class**
   - Implements the Go game environment
   - Handles game rules, move validation, and state transitions
   - Tracks game history and scoring
   - Provides state representation for the neural network

2. **GoNet Class**
   - Neural network architecture for the Go agent
   - Dual-head network with policy and value outputs
   - Convolutional layers for processing board state
   - Policy head outputs move probabilities
   - Value head estimates position evaluation

3. **GoAgent Class**
   - Implements the reinforcement learning agent
   - Uses epsilon-greedy exploration strategy
   - Stores experiences in replay memory
   - Trains on batches of experiences
   - Implements both policy and value learning

4. **GoVisualizer Class**
   - Provides a graphical interface using Pygame
   - Visualizes the game board and stones
   - Displays scores and move counts
   - Enables real-time visualization of agent gameplay

### How to Run the Example

1. **Training the Agents**
   ```python
   from go_rl_example import train_agents
   
   # Train agents for 1000 episodes
   agent1, agent2 = train_agents(episodes=1000, save_path="trained_agents")
   ```

2. **Visualizing a Match**
   ```python
   from go_visualizer import play_match
   
   # Play a match between two agents
   play_match(agent1, agent2, delay=0.5)
   ```

### Key Reinforcement Learning Concepts Demonstrated

1. **State Representation**
   - The board state is represented as a 3-channel tensor
   - Channels represent black stones, white stones, and current player

2. **Action Space**
   - Discrete action space (81 possible moves on a 9x9 board)
   - Special pass move (-1) for strategic passing

3. **Reward Function**
   - Simple territory-based scoring
   - Rewards based on captured stones and controlled territory

4. **Exploration Strategy**
   - Epsilon-greedy exploration with decay
   - Random actions with 10% probability during training
   - 1% probability of passing during random exploration

5. **Neural Network Architecture**
   - Actor-Critic architecture with shared convolutional layers
   - Policy head outputs move probabilities
   - Value head estimates position evaluation

6. **Experience Replay**
   - Stores (state, action, reward, next_state, done) tuples
   - Random sampling for batch training
   - Helps with sample efficiency and stability

### Learning Process

The agents learn through self-play, where they:
1. Play games against each other
2. Store experiences in replay memory
3. Sample batches of experiences for training
4. Update both policy and value networks
5. Gradually improve their gameplay through trial and error

The training process demonstrates key RL concepts like:
- Exploration vs. exploitation
- Delayed rewards
- Policy improvement
- Value function approximation

This example provides a practical implementation of deep reinforcement learning applied to a complex board game, similar to the approach used in AlphaGo.
